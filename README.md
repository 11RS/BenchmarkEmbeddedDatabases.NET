# BenchmarkEmbeddedDatabases.NET
This project contains code that can run benchmarks for the following .NET centric embedded database technologies:

* Access 2013
* SQL Server Compact 4.0.8876.1
* SQL Server Express LocalDB 2012 - 2014 - 2016
* System.Data.Sqlite (1.0.104)

A description of the benchmark results [can be read in this blog post](http://www.diericx.net/post/benchmark-embedded-dotnet-databases/).

## TODO
Some of the components that are used during this benchmark need to be installed and / or configured. Detailed instructions on how to do this will be added here later.
